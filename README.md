# Resume

This is my resume built with LaTeX. The template it's based off of is
`resume.cls` by Trey Hunner. I made some slight modifications to fit
my needs -- my modified version is included in the project also under
`resume.cls`.

## Editing

I use the amazing LaTeX Workshop extension for VSCode to edit this,
which has has some really nice features that `latex-preview-pane.el`
for Emacs unfortunately doesn't have. Just clone the project, and open
the `resume.tex` file.
